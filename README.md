# ContractNow

## Overview

This project is designed to be a service to connect home owners and contractors. We took Angies List as the inspiration for this project. It is designed to have the user (the person looking for someone to do work) post job's and allow contractors to bid on them, or allow for the user to search for contractors to contact specifically.
